                    United States Housing Bubble
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Housing prices peaked in early 2006 and began declining through 2007, hitting new lows by 2011. The sharp drop triggered a credit crisis that significantly contributed to the Great Recession.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Rising foreclosure rates in 2006–2007 disrupted subprime and Alt-A mortgage markets, CDOs, hedge funds, and foreign banks, leading to a broader financial crisis by August 2008. In October 2007 the housing bubble's collapse was identified as a major economic threat.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the collapse of the Housing Bubble, people were missing mortgage payments. This led to a multitude of housing forclosure and a growing concern in housing security.

                <p>
                    While elements of the crisis first became more visible during 2007, several major financial institutions collapsed in late 2008, with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recession.

                <p>
                    Due to the Subprime Mortgage Crisis, Lehman Brothers suffered unprecedented losses, their stock lost 73% of value, they intended to lay off 6% of their workforce and other banks were working on acquiring them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after failing to secure financing amid a pending credit downgrade due to its heavy exposure to subprime mortgages. This remains the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, involving over $600 billion in assets.

                <p>
                    The 2008 Financial Crisis, coupled with a multitude of other factors and global events, caused the Great Recession in 2009. It is said that the Great Recession was the most severe economic and financial meltdown since the Great Depression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The recession hit developed economies hard—especially in North America, South America, and Europe—while many developing countries like China, India, and Indonesia continued to grow. Oceania was also minimally affected, partly due to its ties with Asian markets.

                <p>
                    Due to many major European Banks having invested in America, the effects of the financial crisis and the resulting recession spread. In affected countries, some governments responded with stimulous packages, some resulted in governments falling and some had soverign dept crises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recovery from the Great Recession was slow and uneven across affected countries. In the U.S., the downturn led to lower fertility rates, record-high student debt, and reduced job prospects for young adults. These social effects were expected to persist for years.

                <p>
                   Despite widespread recession, several developing economies such as China, India, and Indonesia experienced significant growth during the downturn. Singapore was initially projected to face its worst recession in 2009 but still managed slight growth at 0.1%, followed by a strong rebound of 14.5% in 2010.  
                </p>
                <p>
                   By March 2009, U.S. stock markets began recovering as major indices rose and banks reported early profitability. The recession was officially declared over by mid-2010, and by 2017, emerging economies accounted for over 70% of global GDP growth.

                    In October 2008, the U.S. launched the $700 billion TARP program to stabilize banks, using $205 billion to recapitalize them. In early 2009, the $787 billion stimulus package was signed, including $75 billion to aid homeowners.

                <p>
                    The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, expanded the money supply, and began purchasing large amounts of assets. It committed to keeping rates near zero until unemployment dropped below 6.5%. Liquidity support mainly benefited developed countries, excluding most developing nations.

                <p>
                    In response to the 2008 financial crisis, several Asian countries cut interest rates and injected liquidity into their banking systems. China launched a massive $586 billion stimulus package focused on infrastructure, social welfare, and domestic development. The stimulus not only stabilized China’s economy but also contributed significantly to global recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other countries like India, Indonesia, Australia, and Taiwan also took monetary actions to support their economies. China additionally raised export tax rebates and signed currency swap agreements to aid liquidity. Across developing economies, stimulus plans ranged from 1–3% of GDP, with China’s totaling a notable 16%.

                <p>
                    Until late 2008, European responses to the crisis were limited, with early efforts focused on tax relief and sector-specific support in countries like Spain and Italy. The EU later proposed a €200 billion stimulus plan, and by early 2009, the UK, Spain, and Germany had launched or expanded national plans. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several banks were partially nationalized, including Fortis in the Benelux countries and Hypo Real Estate in Germany. The UK introduced a £500 billion rescue package for its banking sector. By 2010, many European countries shifted toward fiscal consolidation to reduce deficits while attempting to support recovery.

                <p>
                    Most responses to the 2008 crisis came from individual nations, though some coordination occurred at the European level. To encourage global cooperation, the G-20 was activated, holding its first crisis-focused summit in November 2008 in Washington. Leaders pledged to support their economies, coordinate efforts, and reject protectionism.

                <p>
                    A follow-up summit in April 2009 in London resulted in a $1.1 trillion commitment for coordinated stimulus, credit supply, and support for emerging economies. Central banks agreed to keep interest rates low, while the IMF’s role was strengthened to assist developing countries.

                <p>
                   The belief that major banks were "too big to fail" led to government bailouts and the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act to prevent systemic collapse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Act established watchdog agencies like the FSOC and CFPB, and required large banks to undergo stress tests and limit risky investments Smaller banks and credit unions criticized the law for imposing excessive regulatory burdens.

                <p>
                   The housing market collapsed due to reckless lending to unqualified borrowers and the bundling of risky loans into mortgage-backed securities. Banks insured these loans, creating a fragile system built on debt many couldn’t repay. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, key players in the mortgage market, were bailed out and placed into government conservatorship. Foreclosures soared, home prices dropped sharply, and millions lost their homes. As of 2023, both entities remain under federal oversight.

                   During the crisis, banks' proprietary trading led to significant losses and eroded public trust. The 2014 Volcker Rule aimed to prevent banks from making speculative trades that conflicted with customer interests.

                <p>
                    In 2018, Fed Chair Jerome Powell supported loosening the rule, calling it overly complex. Following the crisis, banks also increased capital requirements, reduced leverage, and lowered exposure to subprime mortgages.
